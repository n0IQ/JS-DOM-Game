#### Rules

- The game involves two players who take alternate turns rolling a die.
- Each player's score starts at zero, and they roll the die (as many times as they wish) to accumulate points for each round.
- If the player rolls a 1, their points for that round are lost, and their turn ends.
- If the player rolls any other number, the points are added to their round score, and they can choose to "hold" or continue rolling the die to accumulate more points.
- If they choose to hold, the points are added to their total score, and their turn ends.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
